# RT-Survival-Guides
This repository contains my personal collection of practical survival guides (aka cheatsheets) that discribe different tools, techniques and procedures mainly focust on conducting red teaming engagements and internal infrastructure pentesting. 

>As the learning journey continues the guides will further mature and be updated regurarly with new content. So stay tuned.

## Credit & References:
The guides in this repo are the product of my own notes that find their origin in multiple publicly and sometimes paid (e.g. CRTO, OSEP) resources. Therefore, all the credits go to the great people behind these courses, blog posts and tools. This repository is meanly a tribute to their work. In the guides, references are made to the repo's and sometimes blog posts were you can find the discribed tools and techniques.
