# RT-Survival-Guides
This repository contains a collection of practical survival guides that discribe different tools, techniques and procedures mainly focust on conducting red teaming engagements and internal infrastructure pentesting. 

The guides in this repo are the product of my own note taking and find their origin in multiple publicly and sometimes paid resources. Therefore, all the credits go to the great people behind these blogs,tools and courses. This repository is mainly a tribute to their work. In the guides, references are made to the repo's and blog posts were you can find the discribed tools and techniques. 

>As my learning journey continues the guides will further mature and be updated regurarly with new content. So stay tuned.

## ToDo:
The following things are currently in the pipeline: more advanced payload development for EDR bypassing; setup C2 infrastructure; external reconnaissance & OSINT gathering; increase the overal quality of the guides.
