# RT-Survival-Guides
This repository contains my personal collection of practical survival guides (aka cheatsheets) that discribe different tools, techniques and procedures mainly focust on conducting red teaming engagements and internal infrastructure pentesting. 

>As the learning journey continues the guides will further mature and be updated regurarly with new content. So stay tuned.

The following guides are currently in the pipeline: setup C2 infrastructure; external reconnaissance & OSINT gathering; more advanced payload development for EDR bypassing; and how to setup and conduct a phishing campaign.  

## Credit & References:
The guides in this repo are based on my own notes that find their origin in multiple publicly available resources. Therefore, all the credits go to the great people in the infosec community that shared their findings, tools and tips with the public. This repository is meanly a tribute to their work. In the guides, references are made to the repo's and sometimes blogs were you can find these tools and techniques.
